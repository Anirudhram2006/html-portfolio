<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey Welcome to my website. Myself Anirudhram here to let you know more about me.
  Currently I am pursuing my first year of college in a reputed institue Easwari Engineering college.
  My specialization course is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology">"Information technology"</a>
  The hilarious part is I am a Bio-math student in my 12th grade tried to clear  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Eligibility_cum_Entrance_Test_(Undergraduate)">NEET</a>
  </p>

<p>Since I couldn't I had no other options(at least as far as I know) than to opt for an engineering course.
  Information technology included all the aspects such as AI,coding all stuffs so I found it interesting and I took it up.
